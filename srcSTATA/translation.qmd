```{stata}
* Load necessary libraries
// Stata doesn't have libraries like R, so no need to load them

* Import the data
import delimited "data/raw/gsoep.dta", clear

* Define a function to remove negative values
program remove_negative_values
    preserve
    keep if whweek >= 0 & hobbies >= 0 & edu4 > 0
    restore
end

* Define a function to create marriage dummies
program create_marriage_dummies
    gen married = .
    gen straight = .
    gen east = .
    gen mixed_origin = .
    gen west = .

    bysort cpf_hid wave: replace married = 1 if _N == 2

* Define a function to generate salary metrics
program generate_salary_metrics

end

* Clean the data
remove_negative_values

* Descriptive statistics
summarize female_income_share if married == 1 & straight == 1 & west == 1 & female == 1, detail

* Table 2

tabulate couple_origin if married == 1 & female == 1 & straight == 1 & (east == 1 | west == 1), summarize(female_count)

* Define a function to prepare data for regression
program prepare_for_regression
    gen hhd_inc = sum(incjob1_mn) if married == 1 & (east == 1 | west == 1)
    gen lhdd_inc = log(hhd_inc)

* Prepare data for regression

drop if missing(hwork)

* Run regressions
